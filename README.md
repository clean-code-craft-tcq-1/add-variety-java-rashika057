# Check and Alert based on types

This exercise is based on the [BMS monitoring] domain.

Expand the checks and alerts to take care of a variety of types.

## Open for Extensions

How can you minimize the amount of work done to add a new type?
Can you add without modifying existing code?

## Implementation

Code contains two code packages:
1) typewiseBreachAlert :- 
     classes are- 
     a) TypewiseAlert:- To check the breach and alert
     b) Battery Character:- It contains the properties of the battery
     Enums are-
     a) CoolingType
     b) BreachType
2) alertTarget:
    It contains different types of Alert notifier classes - Email, console, controller, composite
    
    One test package:
    typewiseBreachAlert: It contains TypewiseAlertTest to test units of TypeWiseAlertClass
